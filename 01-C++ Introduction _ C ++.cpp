// 01-C++ Introduction _ C ++ Tutorial

/* C++ is a general purpose, high-leve, compiler based and object oriented programming language.

General purpose : We are able to design different kinds of software, also called multiple purpose programming language.

E.g.
(i) Operating Systems : DOS, Windows, Linux etc.
(ii) Editors : Wordpad, Notepad, MSWord etc.
(iii) Commercial Applications : College, Hotel, Supermarket, Bank management Systems.
(iv) Database Designing : Oracle, SQL Server, MYSql etc.
(iv) Translators : (Convertor) Converts source code to computer understandable object code.
    Translators are of 3 types viz compiler, interpreter, assembler.
    Note : Compiler and Interpreter both convert HLL to machine code.
           Assembler is used to convert LLL to machine code.
           In C++ we use compiler as translator. Thus, C++ called compiler based language.
(v) Device Drivers : Printer, Hard drives, GPU drivers A driver provides a software interface to hardware devices,
    enabling operating systems and other computer programs to access hardware functions without needing to know precise
    details of the hardware being used.

(vi) PC & Mobile Games : Contra, Mario, Snake etc.
(vii) Protocols : C++ used extensively for this. Fact : Around 90% of telecom protocols are designed with C++.
    e.g. HTTP, FTP, Bluetooth transfer protocol.
